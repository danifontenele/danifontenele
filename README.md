## Hi there 👋

I'm Daniel a  42 Lisbon student exploring the Common Core.

The 42 method helped me to improve solving-problem skill autonomy and discipline.
I'm currently exploring different areas of software development while building a solid foundation in C and computer science.

Core skills:
- C language programming
- Algorithms and data structures
- Unix/Linux environment
- Git and GitHub
- Memory management.

Tools & environment:
- Vim and VSC
- Git
- Makefile

I'm currently discovering which areas of software development ressonate more with me, while focusing in building strong fundamentals.

I value deep understanding, clean code and continuous improvement over rushing to specific languages or technologies.
