## Hi there 👋

I'm Daniel, a curious software engineering student at 42 Lisbon with a strong interest in building reliable systems and meaningful products.

The 42 method is problem-solving skill-based, with a focus on hands-on projects and peer-to-peer learning. Through this approach I'm building a solid base in C and Python while learning how to think critically and collaborate with peers.

### Core skills:
- C language programming
- Python (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Algorithms and data structures
- Unix/Linux environment
- Git and GitHub
---
### Tools & environment:
- Vim and Visual Studio Code
- Git
- Makefile

I value deep understanding, clean code and continuous improvement, and I'm especially motivated by learning how strong software fundamentals translate into real world impact.
