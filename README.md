## Hi there 👋

I'm Daniel a software engineering student at 42 Lisbon.

The 42 method is problem-solving skill-based, with focus on hands-on projects and peer-to-peer learning.
I'm currently exploring different areas of software development while building a solid foundation in C, python and computer science.

### Core skills:
- C language programming
- Python (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Algorithms and data structures
- Unix/Linux environment
- Git and GitHub

### Tools & environment:
- Vim and Visual Studio Code
- Git
- Makefile

I'm currently discovering which areas of software development ressonate more with me, while focusing in building strong fundamentals.

I value deep understanding, clean code and continuous improvement over rushing to specific languages or technologies.
